# Simple Code Challenge Solutions
In this project, I've solved various simple code challenges, including calculating factorial, finding the Prime number, and more.

## Introduction
Code challenges are a great way to practice problem-solving skills and improve programming proficiency. 
These challenges often involve solving a specific problem or implementing an algorithm to achieve a desired outcome.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to showcase solutions to various simple code challenges. 
Each challenge is solved using a programming language of choice, and the solutions are provided along with explanations where necessary.

## Contents
- Each challenge solution is provided in its respective directory.
- Detailed explanations and implementations are included in the source files.
- Additional test cases and edge cases may be provided where applicable.

## Usage
1. **Choose a Challenge**: Navigate to the directory corresponding to the challenge you want to explore.
2. **Review the Solution**: Open the source file containing the solution code and explanation.
3. **Execute the Code**: Run the code in your preferred programming environment or compiler.
4. **Verify the Results**: Test the solution with different inputs to verify correctness and performance.
